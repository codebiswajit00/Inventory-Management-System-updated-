# Inventory-Management-System-updated-
In this Project we are having 2 Json files named as record.json and sales.json for storing the data and a single pynotebook which comprises of adding new entities to the inventory, purchasing from the inventory and updating after that, and managing another json file which stores the data of items sold from the inventory.
